        <h1>This is the Manhattan Bound D train, next stop is…</h1>
        <p>The D train, specifically during its route from 18th ave to Broadway Lafayette, is where I feel one with the city I grew up in. It’s also where 8.80 million people become one. It is much more than just a vehicle that grants me the possibility to get to school, but instead it is a giant needle that stitches the lives of every New Yorker together.</p>
        <p>My alarm that goes off every morning signals the beginning of my race against the clock. I spring out of bed, go through my morning routine and by 6:50, I’m out of the house. As my legs propel me forward, I notice that I’m not running this race alone. Maybe this isn’t a race at all, it’s a marathon. Surrounding me are people striving to catch the same train that I’m running after, they too have somewhere to be and if it weren’t for this marathon I probably would never have ran into them. We each exchange friendly smiles at each other, it's our way of encouraging one another not to give up. Our rush to the train isn’t the only thing stringing us together, the hindering streetlights do so as well. As I wait impatiently at the edge of the street, eyeing the open transit app on my phone to check how much time I have left, I notice that the people that surround me also rely on this app. This doesn’t come as a surprise to me, you wouldn’t be able to survive in New York without it. I feel less alone. The frustration brought about by trains stopping in tunnels is also a community experience, the feelings travel across the entire train chart, filtering into the soul of every person inside it, and adding weight to the air.  To break through this cloud of frustration that engulfs us, we shake our heads in disapproval as we make eye contact with each other. Not going through this inconvenience alone makes it more bearable. Rushing to the train and getting interrupted by a red light, or getting stuck in a tunnel are all things we dread, however these events aren’t terrible in their entirety, it grants New Yorkers the magical opportunity to recognize their similarities with each other, which I think is beautiful.</p>
        <p>There is a reason behind why catching the train in time is such a dire issue for New Yorkers. It’s the intense determination to succeed in life that runs through the veins of every New Yorker. Growing up my mom repeatedly told me that in order to succeed in New York you have to work your ass off, and she wasn’t lying. Everyone accompanying me on the D train is aware of this, and is driven by the motivation to accomplish their goals, whether it be graduating highschool, college or getting to work on time. They serve as an incentive to wake up early each morning, participate in the marathon leading to the train and commit fully to each day's task. New Yorkers would do anything to accomplish their goals, even if it means cramming into an overly packed train.</p>
        <p>The blonde girl who enters my train cart each morning has become my reflection. When I find myself looking over my notes or stressing over my upcoming exam I look up to find her head buried in her notebook as well. She is giving it her all to be the best student that she can be so she can move on to the next big goal of hers, the same way that I am. If you pay enough attention, you’ll discover that everyone on the train is a reflection of one other. In fact, we are all so similar that we stop being strangers to each other. Although it’s impossible to know everyone on a personal level, simply taking the train with the same group of people is enough to piece together a story. Even their stops are clues to who they are and where they’re going. For instance, it indicates that someone goes to Brooklyn Tech. Additionally, facial expressions and outfits can tell you a lot about their morning. Some people even put their phones on speaker while talking to someone, which permits you to learn about who they are. Although eavesdropping isn’t encouraged, the conversation is in the air almost as if it’s inviting me to listen. The people on your train might even be part of a story that you tell your friends. I'm writing about them right now. </p>
        <p>The same way New Yorkers stop being strangers to one another after shared experiences and seeing each other daily, we stop being a stranger to the city after encountering it a few times. The city sees and reads our faces as we stare in awe at the beautiful sunrise it displays to us, the bright orange, red and yellow colors surrounding its buildings bringing us so much comfort. It can see the stress, fatigue, joy and anxiety in our faces. Just how New Yorkers watch the city every day through the windows of the train as it glides against the train tracks, singing its song, the city watches New Yorkers. It has seen me panicking about a test, fighting to keep my eyes open after a long night, grinning from ear to ear at the fact that I get to see all of my friends. The city has seen it all. It's seen us during our highs and lows. It watches us grow up from frightened middle schoolers taking the train alone for the first time to dominating the subway system. It knows us like we know.</p>
        <p>This web of interconnectedness experienced by New Yorkers is made possible by the MTA system, so the next time your train is delayed, don’t get angry, try to embrace it.</p>
